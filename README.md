# Project-hackfest
This project aims to build a simple application and online portal to help in reduction of crime rates in the country. The police needs the help of ordinary citizens to function efficiently which can be made possible with this simple application. We aim to minimize the communication gap between ordinary citizens and the police force. With a few button clicks, people would be able to report any suspicious person or victim that they find anywhere. So, next time if you see any suspicious person or a child begging, all you need to do is click his/her photo and upload it on the app.

There are two versions of the app- Citizen ond police version for citizens and police respectively. Two run the project:

1. Download citizen and police versions.
2. Open android studio and build new projects
3. Import Citizen version
4. Build the app and it can be launched in your phone using usb cable or on android simulator
5. Follow similar steps for police version.
